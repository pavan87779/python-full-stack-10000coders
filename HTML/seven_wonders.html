		<h3>Great Wall of China</h3>
		<p>The Great Wall of China (traditional Chinese: 萬里長城; simplified Chinese: 万里长城; pinyin: Wànlǐ Chángchéng, literally "ten thousand li long wall") is 			a series of fortifications in China. They were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection 	against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. The first walls date to the 7th century BC; these were joined together in the Qin dynasty.[4][5] Successive dynasties expanded the wall system; the best-known sections were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).</p>
